# class_activity2
This was an activity to find the errors in the code and correct them.This includes finding cube pairs to reach the target.
This Python program finds pairs (a, b) where a³ + b³ = target. It works by:
    Finding the cube root limit to keep numbers reasonable.
    Looping through numbers to check all possible pairs.
    Storing valid pairs in a list.
    Printing the results in a clean format.
1³+12³=1+1728=1729  
9³+10³=729+1000=1729
